# discord-py-framework
A framework for discord.py built similar to discord-js frameworks

P.S. Such types of framworks are rarely used, if ever in discord.py. This was made just for fun, and it is not recommended to use in normal cases.

The framework was copied from this js framework: https://github.com/ParallaxWave/discord-js-framework
